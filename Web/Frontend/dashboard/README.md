# AGRISMART
 This is a dynamic and interactive website designed to showcase the Smart Agricultural Monitoring System, which leverages AI and IoT for sustainable farming practices. The system integrates sensors and real-time monitoring to enhance agricultural productivity and resource management.  Key features include:  Soil Monitoring: Tracks nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK) levels, pH, and moisture for optimized crop health. AI Integration: Provides predictive insights to improve yield and reduce resource wastage. Real-Time Dashboard: Displays live/simulated data for soil conditions, temperature, and irrigation. User-Friendly Design: A clean, responsive interface that is accessible across devices. This project aims to empower farmers with modern tools for smarter decision-making and sustainable agriculture.
